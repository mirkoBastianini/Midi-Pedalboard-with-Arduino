# Midi Pedalboard with Arduino

The scope of this project is to realized a MIDI pedalboard controlled with Arduino. I'm using it with Amplitube, but you can use with any program that uses the MIDI protocol.

First of all, I suggest to use <b>Arduino Leonardo</b> because it supports MIDI protocol (with a little hack...). If you want, you can realized this project with any type of Arduino, but in that case you must use a software called <i>Hairless Midi</i> and <i>loopMidi</i>. This software helps you to create a virtual MIDI port and to convert Serial signal into MIDI signal.

By the way, first of all follow this tutorial to prepare the environment <a href="https://github.com/rkistner/arcore">https://github.com/rkistner/arcore</a>.
